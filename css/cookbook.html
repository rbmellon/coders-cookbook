    <h2>About this Cookbook</h2>
    <p>We are often told that art and science are opposite sides of the brain, but I've never believed that for a second. My parents are both "artists" by profession and I am a computer "scientist" myself. Even so, our processes are more similar than they are different. Coding is an art just as baking is a science. Sculpting is a science just as cooking is an art.</p>
    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
      <p>This cookbook wouldn't exist without Megan and Nathan. They taught me not only how to cook, but also to love the creative process and resulting nourishment that food provides.</p>
    <h3>Dedication</h3>
    <p>This cookbook is dedicated to my parents, who taught me that I never have to be just one thing. I hope that these recipes will serve you well, nourishing both body and mind. They are healthful, fun, and packed with love.</p>
